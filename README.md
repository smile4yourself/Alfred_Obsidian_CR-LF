# Alfred_Obsidian_CR-LF

Only tested on a MAC/Big Sur 11.6.3

1. Select some text, 
2. press the keyboard shortcut (CMD+4 in example), and 
3. CR/LF characters will be removed from text
4. the result will go to the clipboard
5. use CNTRL V to paste in in Obsidian. (this was how version 1 worked)
6. Version 2 simply pastes the clipboard contents back to the orriginal selection.

This works quite well for re-editing text output from an OCR program which
converts images of pages to text.
